    "## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dependency Inversion Principle is the D in SOLID. It’s a design rule that reduces coupling and increases architectural stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 The Principle (canonical form)\n",
    "According to the definition:\n",
    "- High‑level modules should not depend on low‑level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.\n",
    "- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.\n",
    "This “inverts” the usual direction of dependency: instead of high‑level code reaching down into concrete implementations, both layers meet at an interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Why DIP matters (operationally)\n",
    "DIP prevents:\n",
    "- Fragile coupling — changes in low‑level code breaking high‑level logic.\n",
    "- Rigid architectures — adding new implementations requires modifying high‑level modules.\n",
    "- Leaky abstractions — high‑level modules knowing too much about implementation details.\n",
    "For someone like you, Dominic—who cares deeply about structural stability, domain boundaries, and explicit abstractions—DIP is basically the architectural guardrail that ensures your domain layer never leaks into infrastructure.\n",
